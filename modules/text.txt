I stare, at the girl in the mirror
T-shirt, torn up jeans, no beauty queen
But the way that you see me
You get underneath me
And all my defenses
Just fall away, fall away
I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
You make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
Just show me this and I believe
I am beautiful with you
I stand naked before you now
No walls to hide behind, so here am I
You see all of my scars
Still here you are
I bare my soul
And I'm not afraid, not afraid
I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
You make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
You show me this and I believe
I am beautiful with you
I've been the strong one for so long
But I was wrong
Doesn't make you weak if you're needing someone
I'm not holding back (yeah)
I know what I want
I am beautiful with you
I am beautiful with you
You want me for myself
You get me like no one else
I am beautiful with you
I am beautiful with you
Even in the darkest part of me
I am beautiful with you
You make it feel the way it's supposed to be
You're here with me
You show me this and I believe
That I am beautiful with you
